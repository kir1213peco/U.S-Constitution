The Constitution of the United States is historical document that should have a formal layout. This document represents our country, so making the colors red, white, and blue seems appropiate. They represent our country, and are also basic colors. They give a sense of respect and authority. For the background, a grey seems nice for a formal document. The background offers contrast to the text, making it easy to read. The title of the webpage will simply be "U.S Constitution with Style" in order to make the page easy to find.

Plan: I will use my previous constituiton, and add color to it. All links should still work, and I will use a stylesheet in order to do most styling. This will make my code understandable and easy to work on and smooth out any kinks if need be. Visual Code Studio can also help me choose fonts if needed, along with colors.


Notes while codeing:

I am finished, but I am going to add rounded corners using border radius. This will make the webpage feel more clean and inviting when compared to sharp corners.
